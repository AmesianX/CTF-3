- ReverseMe ( 250pt )
1. It has a lot of class, method,,, So, static analysis is very hard to reversing.
2. I use jadx and frida.
3. Hook the `delete` and `o.vaehekua.weicigh(int, int, int)`
```
[+] Script is Created...
[+] Script On...
[+] Script is Loaded...
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : A
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : dalvik.system.DexClassLoader
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : loadClass
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : java.io.File
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : delete
[*] delete is hooked...
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : java.io.File
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : listFiles
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : java.io.File
[*] weicighi is hooked...
[*] secret : delete
[*] delete is hooked...
```
4. I guess some file is dropped and delete it.
5. So, i hook `delete` method, then i can get the some `.apk` file.
6. This apk file has suspicious md5 hash string.
7. Decrypt it -> get "Cool" String.
